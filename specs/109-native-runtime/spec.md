# 109 — Native runtime authority

Status: in_progress. Engineering completion remains 107/110.

## Scope and sequence

1. Read coherent Room documents without DOM, writes, initialization or invented defaults.
2. Replace JS session/bootstrap/navigation with native state and explicit domain authority checks.
3. Build screen models from domain repositories instead of mounted HTML.
4. Dispatch native actions directly to command repositories; preserve roles, recovery gates and persisted-before-effects ordering.
5. Replace post-commit orchestration for printing, loyalty, WEB and availability; availability retry only after the next saved payment, no automatic print retry.
6. Replace remaining settings/authentication, import/export and lifecycle handlers without changing backup v13 or exposing credentials.
7. Remove active WebView, JavascriptInterface and DOM adapters only after all preceding boundaries pass parity tests.

## Current increment

MPosRuntimeSnapshot reads an explicitly requested set of raw Room documents in one transaction. Missing documents stay absent; unknown fields and original bytes are preserved. It does not establish domain authority or repair corrupt JSON. Existing runtime remains active; this reader is preparation, not a production cutover.

## Acceptance

Automated: exact payload retention, missing versus stored JSON null, read-only behavior, invalid key rejection and multi-document retrieval. Concurrent coherence stress testing remains pending before bootstrap integration. Subsequent native bootstrap must additionally verify per-domain authority and critical recovery journals before allowing mutations.

Physical acceptance stays in 110: offline startup, employee/shift restore, payment and refund, restart, import/export, all screens and performance. Do not mark 109 done while a hidden WebView still constructs models or dispatches actions.

## Verification of bootstrap reader increment

525/525 JS tests and 415/415 JVM tests passed (no failures/errors/skips); lint: 0 errors, 15 existing warnings. No APK assembly and no physical tablet acceptance. Read-only reader is not connected to production startup yet.
