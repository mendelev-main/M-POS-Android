# Android parity matrix

`implemented` means code exists. Only `accepted` means it passed the physical Android tablet cases.

| Domain | Current state | Remaining evidence |
|---|---|---|
| POS interface and business modules | implemented from iPad commit `44fbf37` | Screenshot and interaction comparison on multiple tablet sizes, aspect ratios and densities |
| Local keys and JSON records | implemented unchanged | Restart, storage failure and large-data checks |
| Products, recipes and stock | web runtime implemented | Full physical sale/return matrix |
| Payments, receipts and shifts | web runtime and native shift PDF printing implemented | Cash/card/split, restart recovery and printed output |
| Purchasing, receiving and inventory | web runtime implemented | Weighted cost, draft restart and reports |
| Product photos | native implementation | Picker, rotation, large image, restart and backup |
| Complete backup v13 | native implementation | iPad → Android and Android → clean Android restore |
| LAN ESC/POS | native raster implementation | 58/80 mm printers, routing, copies and timeouts |
| Warehouse PDF/XLSX | native implementation | Exact values and visual comparison with iPad |
| Purchase-order sharing | native PDF implementation | Android share sheet and multi-page document |
| Telegram text/shift/monthly reports | implemented; shift close currently uses a text summary | Compare delivery and decide whether Android also needs the iPad raster image |
| WEB orders and availability | shared runtime implemented | SSE reconnect, acceptance recovery and post-payment stock |
| Release/update installation | pending | Stable signing key and `adb install -r` data retention |

The iPad application remains the production source of truth until every critical row is accepted.
